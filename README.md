# prediction-of-prostate-cancer
my research work

This repository contains a neural network based on a genetic algorithm that predicts the Gleason sum. Glyson sum shows the degree of danger of a tumor in prostate cancer.

Program "neural_network_ga.py" is essentially a neural network library. 
Program "nn_launch.py" is needed to run.
Program "training_db.py" contains test sample.
